Problem Statement: Given a number of stairs and a frog, the frog wants to climb from the 0th stair to the (N-1)th stair. 
At a time the frog can climb either one or two steps. A height[N] array is also given. 
Whenever the frog jumps from a stair i to stair j, the energy consumed in the jump is abs(height[i]- height[j]), where abs() means the absolute difference. 
We need to return the minimum energy that can be used by the frog to jump from stair 0 to stair N-1..

Example 1:
Input: heights = [2, 1, 3, 5, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible route can be,
0th step -> 2nd Step = abs(2 - 3) = 1
2nd step -> 4th step = abs(3 - 4) = 1
Total = 1 + 1 = 2.

Example 2:
Input: heights = [7, 5, 1, 2, 6]
Output: 9
Explanation: One possible route can be,
0th step -> 1st Step = abs(7 - 5) = 2
1st step -> 3rd step = abs(5 - 2) = 3
3rd step -> 4th step = abs(2 - 6) = 4
Total = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.
